# Spam-Classifier
A NLP Text Classification model using NLTK and Scikit Learn exploiting Naive Bayes Classifier which differentiates spam emails from useful ones.

# Prerequisites
1. iPython Notebook (Jupyter preferably)
2. python packages - pip, os, numpy, pandas, scipy
3. data visualization packages - matplotlib, seaborn
4. ML packages - scikit learn

# Dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection
Dataset imported from UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains over 5000 SMS labeled messages that have been collected for mobile phone spam research.

# Procedural Workflow
1. Import packages.
2. Data preprocessing using Regexp and NLP
3. Feature generation
4. Training model with multiple sklearn algorithms and ensemble methods
5. Testing and accuracy evaluation with corr matrix
